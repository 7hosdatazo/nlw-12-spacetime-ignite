## What is a vocoder and how does it work?
  
A vocoder is a device or a plugin that analyzes the frequency spectrum of one sound source (the modulator) and applies it to another sound source (the carrier), creating a new sound that combines the characteristics of both sources.
  
The modulator is usually a human voice or a speech signal, while the carrier can be any sound source, such as a synthesizer, a guitar, or a drum loop. The vocoder splits both signals into a series of frequency bands and then controls the amplitude of each band in the carrier according to the amplitude of the corresponding band in the modulator.
  
The result is a sound that sounds like the carrier is speaking or singing with the modulator's voice. This effect can be used to create robotic, futuristic, or harmonized vocals, as well as other creative sound design possibilities.
